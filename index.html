		The enigma machine was a mechanical encryption device originally developed for commercial purposes, by german engineer Arthur Scherbius in 1918.
		</p>

		<p> 
		During World War 2 however, the enigma machine became a powerful tool used by Nazi Germany in order to encrypt military messages (before sending them over radio lines in the form of morse code).

		The enigma machine consisted of several conponents. the first component was a 'plug board' which you could use to sustitute one letter for another by cross wiring them. 
		</p>

		<p>
		the second component was the 'Rotors'. There were usually 5 different rotors to choose from, but only 3 could be loaded into the enigma machine, adding a further degree of randomness. To make things more complicated, the 3 rotots could be arranged in different orders, to give different encryptions.
		</p>

		<p>
		The third component was the reflector, which would light up when pressing a button on the enigma machine. The reflector helped the user record the encrypted/decrypted message.
		</p>

		<p>
		The enigma machine was therefore possible to encrypt a message in 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 different ways!

		<p>
		It became possible to decrypt the enigma machine through the work of a team of mathematicians, linguists, and military intelligence gathering. 
		</p>

		<p>
		The first useful discovery was that the enigma machine could never decrypt a letter as itself.
		</p>

		<p>
		Secondly, it became known that the Germans always sent weather reports first thing in the morning, and so the focus became to decode keywords relating to the weather, such as 'rain'.
		</p>

		<p>
		Also, the common use of the expression “Heil Hitler” at the end of messages (as discovered through military intelligence), became another keyword to search for.
		</p>

		<p>
		Finally, the development of an electrical circuit machine known as the "Bombe machine", gave the Allies a means to check for possible solutions at an unprecedented speed; by ruling out incompatible enigma configurations using the above-mentioned conditions.
		</p>

		<p>
		The remaining list of possible solutions were then manually checked by humans against the rest of the message for further matches; thus making it possible to break any enigma code in less than 20 minutes!
