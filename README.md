# HIT226

Welcome 

Here you will find a website outline which I have created to incorporate my two topics of focus for my teaching degree: 
Language and Information Technology.

For this reason, I have picked a historically significant event where linguists and mathematicians worked side by side 
and changed the course of history during the second world war.

It is of course the creation of the Turing machine used to decrypt the German encrypted enigma messages.

The enigma machine was a mechanical machine which the Germans used to encrypt messages with 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 different combinations!

Therefore, it was impossible to ever decrypt the messages by brute force due to the total number of different combinations.

This is where linguists and mathematicians worked together towards Alan Turing's innovative solution:
"Enigma is a machine. A very 
well-designed machine. Our problem 
is that weâ€™re trying to beat it 
with men. What if only a machine 
can defeat another machine?"
(The imitation game, 2014)
